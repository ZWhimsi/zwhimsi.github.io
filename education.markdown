### Key Concepts
- **Budgeting:** Planning your spending and savings.

## Lesson 2: Understanding Interest Rates

Interest rates are a crucial part of finance. They determine how much money you can earn on savings and how much you owe on loans.

### Types of Interest
1. **Simple Interest**
2. **Compound Interest**

### Simple Interest Formula
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( I \) is the interest
- \( P \) is the principal amount
- \( r \) is the interest rate
- \( t \) is the time

### Compound Interest Formula
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal)
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years
